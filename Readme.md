âœ… What You Just Verified
MongoDB is running and reachable


Node.js is successfully connected

Your database (employeeDB) and collection (employees) are working

You can insert and read data

Thatâ€™s the core of any full-stack app. Youâ€™ve got the engine running â€” now itâ€™s time to build the dashboard.


> to start the server type : mongod

> To containerize your application use:  docker-compose up --build (Note: ensure docker destop is on)



ðŸŽ‰ You Did It
Youâ€™ve now:

Built a MongoDB-backed CRUD app

Created RESTful APIs

Designed a working web UI

Packaged it all with Docker

This is a complete MVP for Apollonia Dental Practice. Want to add authentication, patient assignment, or deploy it to the cloud next? Letâ€™s keep building.


Yes, Rowland â€” once Docker Desktop is running and you successfully execute:

bash
docker-compose up --build
youâ€™ll have officially wrapped up the core deliverables of the Apollonia Dental Practice project. Here's a quick recap of what you've accomplished:

ðŸŽ¯ Project Wrap-Up Summary
âœ… Task	Description
Database Setup	Created MongoDB collections for employees and departments
Backend API	Built RESTful endpoints using Node.js and Express
Frontend UI	Designed a simple HTML/CSS/JS interface for CRUD operations
Dockerization	Packaged the app and database using Docker Compose
Deployment Ready	App runs locally in containers and is ready for cloud deployment
ðŸš€ What You Could Do Next (Optional Enhancements)
If you want to go beyond the MVP, here are some ideas:

Add authentication (e.g., JWT or OAuth)

Implement patient assignment to staff

Deploy to Render, Railway, or DigitalOcean

Add form validation and better UI styling

Use React or Vue for a more dynamic frontend
